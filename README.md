# TechCare
I developed TechCare to manage maintenance and quality operations for batteries and device chargers at Al-Awael Company.
The app allows scheduling maintenance, ensuring quality standards are applied to devices, and printing detailed invoices about the stages the devices went through during maintenance.
This enhances operational efficiency and provides an exceptional experience for the company’s employees.
I used BLoC for state management, Clean Architecture for a scalable and maintainable structure, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high code quality and reliability throughout the development process.
These practices helped deliver a robust and efficient application.
